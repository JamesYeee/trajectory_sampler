1.v_y not correct

2.samples with a speed less than 0.2 were removed. because the force suddenly reduce to 0, and brake will be large(feasibility has not yet been assessed)

3.sampler in action space maybe can use in AVs, but cant be used in robot dog.

4. every pedal and brake in .csv should at first be scaled, and then normalized for training(to do), so in sampler scaled - normalization - train - denormalization
